  <b>The MapLibre Organization is an umbrella for open-source mapping libraries.</b>
</p>


Welcome to the MapLibre organization!  
We build and maintain open-source tools and libraries for interactive maps and geospatial visualization — empowering developers, researchers, and organizations to create world-class mapping applications.

## 🌍 Our Vision

Our goal is to ensure that everyone has free access to high-quality, open-source mapping technology.  
We strive to provide performant, feature-rich, and developer-friendly libraries that make it easy to transform raw geospatial data into beautiful visualizations — **from bits to pixels.**

## 🧭 What We Do

MapLibre develops and maintains:
- **Rendering libraries** like MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native
- **Map servers and tools** such as Martin and Maputnik
- **Ecosystem tools** and integrations that make it easier to work with open geospatial data

Our work is entirely open source, and contributions from individuals and organizations around the world make it possible.  

Visit [maplibre.org](https://maplibre.org) to learn more about our projects, documentation, and community initiatives.

## 🤝 Get Involved

We’d love to have you join our community!  
There are several ways to connect and collaborate:

- **GitHub Discussions, Issues, and Pull Requests**  
  Every MapLibre repository is open for contributions and discussions. Share feedback, suggest improvements, or submit your code!
- **Slack**  
  Join the MapLibre Slack, hosted by [OpenStreetMap US](https://slack.openstreetmap.us).  
  After joining, hop into the `#maplibre` channel and other topic-specific rooms like `#maplibre-gl-js`.
- **Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Meetings**  
  Our TSC meets monthly (typically the second Wednesday of each month, evening Europe time).  
  Meetings are open to everyone! The Zoom link is shared in Slack about a week before the meeting.
