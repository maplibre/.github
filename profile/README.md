# MapLibre
**The MapLibre Organization is an umbrella for open-source mapping libraries.**

Welcome to the MapLibre organization!  
We build and maintain open-source tools and libraries for interactive maps and geospatial visualization — empowering developers, researchers, and organizations to create world-class mapping applications.

## 🌍 Our Vision

Our goal is to ensure that everyone has free access to high-quality, open-source mapping technology.  
We strive to provide performant, feature-rich, and developer-friendly libraries that make it easy to transform raw geospatial data into beautiful visualizations — **from bits to pixels.**

## 🧭 What We Do

MapLibre develops and maintains:
- **Rendering libraries** like MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native
- **Map servers and tools** such as Martin and Maputnik
- **Ecosystem tools** and integrations that make it easier to work with open geospatial data

Our work is entirely open source, and contributions from individuals and organizations around the world make it possible.

- **GitHub Discussions, Issues, and Pull Requests**  
  Every MapLibre repository is open for contributions and discussions. Share feedback, suggest improvements, or submit your code!
- **Slack**  
  Join the MapLibre Slack, hosted by [OpenStreetMap US](https://slack.openstreetmap.us).  
  After joining, hop into the `#maplibre` channel and other topic-specific rooms like `#maplibre-gl-js`.
- **Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Meetings**  
  Our TSC meets monthly (typically the second Wednesday of each month, evening Europe time).  
  Meetings are open to everyone! The Zoom link is shared in Slack about a week before the meeting.
